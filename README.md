The DEXA-C097/C133 controller itself is compatible with either 9.7 inch or 13.3 inch E Ink display panel but the hardware design by Cinread made this a little bit complicated since you have to use an extension cable so to connect the interface on the board that's 9.7 inch's and then goes to the 13.3 inch's FPC.
That's all.
